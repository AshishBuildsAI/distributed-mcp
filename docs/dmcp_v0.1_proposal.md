<b>Distributed Model Context Protocol (dMCP)</b> is a proposed extension to the original Model Context Protocol (MCP), introducing asynchronous, event-driven, and distributed communication between agents, models, and context providers.

While MCP successfully defines tightly coupled, synchronous interaction patterns for model reasoning, dMCP enables large-scale, loosely coupled agentic ecosystems where reasoning happens independently and context evolves over time through events.


### Motivation

As the number and diversity of autonomous agents grow, synchronous, request-response communication becomes a bottleneck.

#### Real-world agent systems need:

	â€¢	Asynchronous communication: Agents publish and consume context updates at independent timescales.

	â€¢	Loose coupling: Producers and consumers of context need not know each otherâ€™s identity.

	â€¢	Durability and resilience: Context and tasks survive temporary failures or disconnections.

	â€¢	Parallelism: Multiple agents can reason simultaneously on partially overlapping contexts.

Distributed MCP addresses these requirements by extending MCP into an event-driven, message-brokered architecture, while preserving its core principles of structured context management and model alignment.


### Scalability Challenge in MCP based Synchronous Mult-Agent Systems

The original MCP design assumes direct, blocking request-response communication between agents and models. While this works well for small, tightly scoped systems, it becomes a major bottleneck in larger multi-agent environments:

	â€¢	Blocking Fragility: One slow agent stalls the entire chain of reasoning.
	â€¢	Sequentialism: Agents must reason one after another, missing opportunities for parallel thought.
	â€¢	Brittle Failures: Timeouts or unresponsive agents collapse entire multi-agent processes.
	â€¢	Resource Strain: Requires all agents to be online and responsive simultaneously.

Real-world intelligent systems (human organizations, ecosystems, neural networks) operate asynchronously and tolerate delays naturally.

To mirror this robustness, agentic systems must evolve beyond synchronous blocking models.

Distributed MCP embraces this reality by allowing agents to communicate via durable message exchanges, making progress independently while asynchronously integrating shared context.

These insights are drawn from practical experience building AI Fireside Chat frameworks, where real-world agentic conversations revealed the natural need for asynchronous coordination.


### Key Concepts

Concept	dMCP	MCP
Communication	Asynchronous, message-based	Synchronous, direct
Coupling	Loose	Tight
Context Evolution	Event streams, updates over time	Immediate context bundle
Reliability	Message durability, retries	Immediate or fail-fast
Memory Scope	Distributed and persistent	Local to session/call


### dMCP Architecture

Agents, models, and services communicate via a distributed message bus (e.g., AMQP/RabbitMQ, Redis Streams, NATS).

Core Components
	â€¢	Context Producers: Publish partial or full context updates.
	â€¢	Context Consumers: Subscribe to relevant context updates.
	â€¢	Model Executors: Listen for prompts or decision tasks, produce outputs, and optionally publish them.
	â€¢	Context Broker: Routes events between participants, manages topics/queues.
	â€¢	Session Manager (optional): Maintains coherent long-running multi-agent sessions.

Message Types

Type	Description
context_update	New or modified context payloads
prompt_request	Request for model reasoning or task execution
prompt_response	Response to a prompt or decision task
error_notification	Errors or exceptions during processing
agent_heartbeat	Health monitoring and presence signaling

Example Flow
	1.	Sensor Agent publishes a context_update: "New event: Pressure anomaly detected."
	2.	Planning Agent subscribes to anomalies, receives the event, and triggers a prompt_request to a Model Executor.
	3.	Model Executor processes the request asynchronously, emits a prompt_response suggesting mitigation steps.
	4.	Control Agent picks up the plan from the message bus and executes the real-world action.

âœ… All of this happens without any direct synchronous calls.

Formal dMCP Message Structure

Each dMCP message is a JSON object:

{
  "dMCP_version": "0.1",
  "type": "context_update | prompt_request | prompt_response | error_notification | agent_heartbeat",
  "session_id": "optional session grouping",
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601 UTC",
  "sender_id": "agent-name-or-uuid",
  "payload": { "structured_data": "depends on message type" }
}

Backward Compatibility with MCP
	â€¢	dMCP is a superset of MCP ideas: agents operating within a synchronous MCP session could be wrapped as microservices under dMCP.
	â€¢	Adapters can bridge dMCP event streams into traditional MCP synchronous APIs where needed.

â¸»

Future Work
	â€¢	dMCP-Streams: Formalize persistent event replay for training models.
	â€¢	Security: Define optional signing and encryption layers.
	â€¢	Quality of Service (QoS): Define message priority, retries, and dead-letter queues.
	â€¢	Agent Profiles: Standardize agent capabilities and presence announcements.
